# ***Rental House Analysis (In Progress)***<br><br>


## ***Project Overview***

This project aims to assist me in finding the ideal rental house as I plan to move. Balancing affordable living costs and high quality of living is crucial. I can make an informed decision by evaluating factors such as rental prices, crime rates, job opportunities, and other metrics across different cities. Python will be used for data analysis, and interactive Tableau dashboards will visualize the results.

### ***Key Objectives:***
- Determine the project scope: Should the analysis consider factors beyond rental prices and crime rates?
- Collect data from various sources utilizing Python, APIs, or web scraping tools.
- Analyze historical and current rental prices across different regions to uncover trends.
- Develop interactive Tableau dashboards to present insights and findings effectively. <br><br>
